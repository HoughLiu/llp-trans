This chapter was a brief historical note on processor evolution over the last 30 years. We have also elaborated on the intended use of segments back in the 32-bit era, as well as which leftovers of segmentation we are stuck with for legacy reasons. In the next chapter we are going to take a closer look at the virtual memory mechanism and its interaction with protection rings.

本章对处理器 30 年的发展历史进行了回顾。我们对 32 位时代的段的使用目的也进行了详细阐述，以及历史遗产如何使我们陷入了麻烦。下一章我们会对虚拟内存管理和 protection ring 的交互进行介绍。
