本章对冯诺伊曼架构进行了概述。从为这个模型添加简单功能一直到使其能够描述现代处理器。目前为止我们对寄存器和硬件栈也有了一定的了解。下一章节将会开始进行汇编编程的学习。我们将见到一些样例程序，确定几个新的架构特点\(例如大小端和寻址模式\)，并且将会为 \*nix 系系统设计一套简单的 input/output 库来简化与用户间的交互。

Question 2

What are the key principles of von Neumann architecture?

Question 3

What are registers?

Question 4

What is the hardware stack?

Question 5

What are the interrupts?

Question 6

What are the main problems that the modern extensions of the von Neumann model are trying to solve?

Question 7

What are the main general purpose registers of Intel 64?

Question 8

What is the purpose of the stack pointer?

Question 9

Can the stack be empty?

Question 10

Can we count elements in a stack?
