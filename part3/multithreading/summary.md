17.13 Summary

In this chapter we have studied the basics of multithreaded programming. We have seen the different memory models and the problems that emerge from the fact compiler and hardware optimizations mess with the instruction execution order. We have learned how to control them, placing different memory barriers, we have seen whyvolatileis not a solution to problems that emerge from multithreading. Then we introducedpthreads, the most common standard of writing multithreaded applications of Unix-like systems. We have seen thread management, used mutexes and condition variables, and learned why spinlocks only have meaning on multicore and multiprocessor systems. We have seen how memory reorderings should be taken into account even when working on an usually strong architecture such as Intel 64 and have seen the limits of its strictness. Finally, we have studied the atomic variablesâ€”a very useful feature of C11 that allows us to get rid of explicit mutex usage and in many cases boost performance while maintaining correctness. Mutexes are still important when we want to perform complex manipulations on non-trivial data structures.
