14.9 小结

In this chapter we have revisited the calling convention used in \*nix on Intel 64. We have seen the example usages of the more advanced C features, namely,volatileandrestricttype qualifiers and non-local jumps. Finally, we have given a brief overview of several classical vulnerabilities that are possible because  
 of the way stack frames are organized, and the compiler features that were designed to automatically cope with them. The next chapter will explain more low-level details related to the creation and usage of dynamic libraries to strengthen our understanding of them.
