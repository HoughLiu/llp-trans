Chapter 15 Shared Objects and Code Models

Chapter5already provided a short overview of dynamic libraries \(also known as shared objects\). This chapter will revisit dynamic libraries and expand our knowledge by introducing the concepts of the Program Linkage Table and the Global Offset Table. As a result, we will be able to build a shared library  
 in pure assembly and C, compare the results, and study its structure. We will also study a concept of code models, which is rarely discussed but gives a consistent view of several important details of assembly code generation.
