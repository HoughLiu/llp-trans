16.5 Summary

In this chapter we have talked about the compiler optimizations and why they are needed. We have seen how far the translated optimized code can go from its initial version. Then we have studied how to get the most benefit from caching and how to parallelize floating point computations on the instruction level using SSE instructions. In the next chapter we will see how to parallelize instruction sequences execution, create multiple threads, and change our vision of memory in the presence of multithreading.
